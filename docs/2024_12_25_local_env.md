- same for other OpenAPI-based applications
- localhost no auth connections from clients


The server should be able to run with a UDS socket server, and may be launched
localy (in a container) too. 

CLI code:

Tests should also be defined as services - with a (generated) test wrapper.
Lints, probes, runbooks - same.
